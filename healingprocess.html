      <h2 class="header">Although we can facilitate your healing process, your will determines the outcome.
        The following guidelines will assist you with attaining optimum results:</h2>
      <ol class="aero">
        <li>Faith in the innate intelligence that lies within your, and your ability to attain your fullest potential for health, happiness, abundance, and soul purpose.</li>
        <li>Trust in the healing process</li>
        <li>Be willing to look at negative patterns, even those that may be emotionally painful or that ask you to take responsibility for the part that you played in their formation.</li>
        <li>Choose to replace negative patterns with those needed to attain health. Eliminationg poor habits and reducing stress factors will be of great assistance to you, as well as thinking positive thoughts, having balanced emotions, committing to a preoper diet and exercise, and getting enough sleep. </li>
        <li>Communicate honestly with Dr. Cox about any aspect of your care that you do not understand or that concerns you. If there are physical symptoms or feelings that arise during your healing process, it is often helpful to discuss those as well.</li>
        <li>Educate yourself about your body and the healing process. Periodically, Dr. Cox will provide you with literature to take home and read. It is important that you read this information and that you ask questions about any aspect that you may not fully understand.</li>
        <li>Rest your body, mind, and spirit. Find a method of relaxation that works for you. Some possibilities are Yoga, meditation, deep breathing, sitting in the woods, artwork, etc. Take time daily (even if it's only for ten minutes) to still yourself. It is in this state that you will find the ultimate connection to your innate intelligence.</li>
        <li>Comply with your treatment plan and healthcare schedule, including taking supplements and exercising as recommended, eliminating poor habits or addictions, and scheduling and arriving for health care sessions as recommended.</li>
      </ol>
