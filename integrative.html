        <h2 class="header">Chiropractic</h2>
        

        <p class="aero">In 1895, D. D. Palmer was operating out of his clinic and
          made the choice to examine a janitor working in his building named
          Harvey Lillard. Mr. Lillard had lost his hearing after falling down
          a flight of stairs a year earlier. Dr. Palmer was intrigued by
          the events of the fall and Harvey’s loss of hearing. In examining
          Mr. Lillard, Palmer felt a suspicious area in Harvey’s upper back.
          He determined that the 4th thoracic vertebra was malpositioned
          and devised a method to replace its positioning with his hands.
          This procedure resulted in the restoration of Mr. Lillard’s hearing,
          and the development of theories regarding what Palmer called
          Chiropractic. In Greek, Chiro meaning hand and prassein meaning
          to do. So, “To Do With Hands”.</p>

        <p class="aero">Throughout the last 100 plus years, much has been learned
          about the intimate relationship of the spine and nervous system.
          The bone structure of the spine and cranium with its muscular and
          connective tissues protect the nervous system, but also provide
          tremendous amounts of input that allow the nervous system to optimally
          adapt to the environment. As these structures relate well, movement
          is optimized, and the nervous system is fueled to regulate other
          systems in power and harmony. This adds to the central role of
          the nervous system to regulate, control, and to be safe. Many
          of these supportive tissues hold the guarded states of protection
          when our systems have not let go and come out of a triggered alarm.
          These alarm states exist due to perceived threat/injury and
          prevent the nervous system from restoring to healing and
          rebuilding mode, or at least make it struggle to do so. Many
          of these perceived threats are based on the programming of
          our minds as well as unresolved emotional hurts. As our
          nervous system experiences ease, it effortlessly rights
          and balances our body.</p>

        <p class="aero">Occasionally, we are exposed to chemicals that our
          body perceives as toxic. If our nervous system does not coordinate
          the rapid neutralization and removal of the toxic chemical, we
          suffer feelings of sickness, fever, and agitation/fatigue. These
          are all ways that our bodies are attempting to deal with
          something that it is in conflict with them. The big idea of
          Chiropractic is to remove things that are affecting your
          nervous system in a way that’s keeping it from optimizing
          your relationship with your environment. Facilitating it
          to be stronger through encouragement and new concepts are
          also a part of this process.</p>
          <hr>
          <p class="aero">"Chiropractic is the science of applied neurophysiologic diagnosis based on the theory that health and disease
            are life processes related to the function of the nervous system: irritation of the nervous system by
            mechanical, chemical, or psychic factors is the cause of disease; restoration and maintenance of health depend
            on normal function of the nervous system. Diagnosis is the identification of these noxious irritants and treatment is
            their removal by the most conservative method."</p>

        <h2 class="header">TCM/Acupuncture</h2>
        <p class="aero">Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) has evolved over
          thousands of years. TCM practitioners use various mind/body
          practices (such as acupuncture, tai chi, qi gong, and meditation)
          as well as herbal medicines to address health problems. We use
          principles to determine if certain imbalances are hindering
          health. We look to see if there are excessive factors of heat,
          cold, dampness, or dryness in a person’s body that may point
          to imbalances fueled by dietary or lifestyle issues. Along
          with our manual techniques, we also use acupuncture to
          assist with the free flow of communication within the
          channels of the body. As the body is balanced coupled
          with free flow of qi (bio-electricity and signaling
          gases) and blood, health expresses.</p>

        <h2 class="header">Osteopathy</h2>
        <p class="aero">Osteopathy was developed by Dr. A. T. Still in the
          late 1800’s. He was a surgeon in the American Civil War. He felt
          that some of the basic medical practices of his day were
          dangerous and ineffective and so developed the theories of
          Osteopathy. Greek osteon meaning bone and pathos meaning
          suffering. Many of his ideas were similar to D.D. Palmer’s
          Chiropractic in that they both agreed that skeletal structure
          issues caused problems in the body. Dr. Still was known as the
          “Lightening Bonesetter” and had a reputation for the ability to
          treat many conditions from dysentery to back problems
          affecting the sciatic nerve.</p>
        <p class="aero">There were Chiropractors that became Osteopaths, and
          Osteopaths that became Chiropractors. Dr. Palmer developed his
          theories around skeletal structure issues affecting nerve function,
          and Dr. Still developed his theories around skeletal structure issues
          affecting vascular function. As a matter of fact, here’s a quote from
          Dr. Still (and it is one of the reasons we implement some of these
          principles in our clinical care): “THE RULE OF THE ARTERY IS
          SUPREME”. It is vital to understand that nutrients are supplied
          to cells for repair and regeneration through the vascular system.
          It is also super important to understand that in order for that
          fresh supply to get there, all of the old waste materials must
          be removed first. This is why drainage of those tissues by
          the lymphatic system and venous system need to be optimized.</p>
        <p class="aero">Throughout the years, several pieces of the puzzle have
          linked the two professions. These are the functions of cranial
          bones, fascia, and the autonomic nervous system. You can find more
          information <a href="https://osteodoc.com/philosophy/#:" class="link-success">here</a> that supports the
          integrative philosophy. We
          use
          gentle manual techniques that free up tissues that allow for
          healthy lymphatic and vascular flow. Sometimes this involves working
          with the visceral structures of the body as well as structures
          within the cranium (skull), thoracic inlet, respiratory diaphragm,
          and pelvic diaphragm.</p>
          <hr>
        <p class="aero">“Osteopathy is a system of medical practice based on a
          theory that diseases are due chiefly to loss of structural
          integrity which can be restored by manipulation of the parts
          supplemented by therapeutic measures...”</p>
