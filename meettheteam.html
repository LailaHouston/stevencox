        <h2 class="header">Dr. Steven Cox, D.C., P.Ac.</h2>
        <h5 class="header">Owner/Clinician</h5>
        <p class="aero"> Dr. Cox is a native of Mississippi and received his undergraduate degree from Mississippi State
          University.
          After this he took a teaching position for a top pharmaceutical company where he focused on the central
          nervous system,
          cardiovascular medicine, and infectious disease. After seeing a questionable trend in the pharmaceutical
          industry, he pursued
          a doctoral program at Logan University's College of Chiropractic. In addition to the traditional training
          (which consisted of human
          anatomy, physiology, psychology, biochemistry, nutrition, neurology, biomechanics, physical diagnosis, lab
          diagnosis, philosophy,
          and many conservative natural health techniques), Dr. Cox also completed several thousand combined hours of
          post-doctoral training
          in advanced neurology, TCM/Acupuncture, Functional Medicine, Applied Kinesiology, and many specialized mind/
          body techniques.</p>
        <p class="aero">Dr. Cox has been in clinical practice for over 22 years and attracted a wide array of
          patients with conditions ranging from acute muscle and joint injuries to various chronic problems such as
          pain/inflammatory syndromes,
          hormone imbalances, digestive dysfunction, allergies, fatigue, and many stress related disorders.</p>
        <p class="aero">He is a competitive tennis player playing both in adult tournaments and team tennis. In addition
          to practicing several
          martial arts from an early age, Dr. Cox was also trained as a cavalry scout by the U.S. Army, serving in a
          reconnaissance role.</p>

                <h2 class="header">LaTonya Houston</h2>
                <h5 class="header">Organizational Analyst</h5>
                <p class="aero">LaTonya was trained as a multi-communications specialist with the U.S. Army. She is the
                  mother of four awesome children.
                  This includes two sons and two daughters with a wonderful daughter-in-law. She also has four
                  "grand-dogs". She has a vast background in
                  marketing, organizational collaboration, customer service, and teaching.</p>

                <p class="aero">During her Junior year at Union University, she became a Ned McWherter Scholar where she
                  was encouraged to make a difference
                  in her home community and surrounding area as an agent of change. She graduated with a Bachelor of
                  Science in Organizational Leadership/Management.</p>

                <p class="aero">LaTonyaâ€™s passion to make change is carried over into her relentless study of how
                  feelings from the past can inhibit true potential.
                  Understanding this has allowed her to examine and process her own experience in a context to bring out
                  the radiant nature of her true self. Through
                  this, she inspires others to do the same.</p>

                <p class="aero">Growing up with grandparents in rural Tennessee, she learned the benefits of fresh air,
                  clean water, and connection with nature. Her
                  love for nature guides her toward hobbies teeming with life such as hiking, specific breathing
                  exercises, strength training, gardening, healthy cooking,
                  and crafting. She is also an avid researcher of holistic medicine.</p>
