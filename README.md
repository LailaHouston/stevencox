# Aero Mind & Body

Aero Mind & Body is an integrated approach of healing the whole body through holistic practices. This facilitates people into their own healing but sometimes the body needs assistance to guide the body through the process and facilitate people into their ideal image. The owner of this organization is Dr. Steven Cox, who has been in clinical practice for over 22 years. He was delighted to let us build a website for him, given that he did not have one from the beginning which works out pretty well for all of us. This website was created by Laila Houston and Mitzi Castro and we both attend Madison Academic High School in Jackson Tennessee. We created this website for a chiropractor/acupuncturist who is currently rebranding his business to have a more professional image.
